A multi-page responsive website of a fictitious restaurant.

## Description
This was the final project I did as a part of a Coursera course - 'HTML,CSS and JavaScript For Web Developers' (https://www.coursera.org/learn/html-css-javascript-for-web-developers/home/welcome). This is a basic multi-page responsive website of a fictitious restaurant, which can be used as a template for building restaurant portfolio websites.

It showcases the basic features of a restaurant such as main seating area, google location, menu categories, working hours and reviews. Besides, there's also a Specials category which is randomly updated every time the Specials category page loads - so that you can get a flavour of all ;-) (All thanks to JavaScript!).

This website also implements responsiveness for comfortable user experience in all kind of screen size devices.

This project is my first experience as part of Web Development.


## Tech Stack used:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Bootstrap (CSS Framework)
- JS
- jQuery (JS Library)


## Limitations
* The 'About' and 'Awards' options have not been implemented yet.
* The home page currently has one static image of a restaurant, which I intend to turn into an image slideshow as the Gallery of the restaurant later.
* The overall functionality of this website is basic and can be made more efficient to create a real world product.


## Key Learnings
* Learnt HTML5,CSS and JavaScript all from scratch
* Learnt about media queries and implementing responsiveness
* Got working experience with tools such as Visual Studio Code
* Got a glimpse into the World Of Web
* Made code readable and documentation


## Acknowledgements
I would like to thank Prof. Yaakov Chain (@[Yaakov Chain](https://clearlydecoded.com/)) for his highly extensive and methodical lectures on the basics of Web Development. I never could have imagined implementing a full-fledged web site all from scratch.
I would also like to credit [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) for guiding me out every little loophole in my code.
